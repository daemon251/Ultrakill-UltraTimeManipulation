# OVERVIEW

This mod was inspired by the game 'Katana Zero', which has a prominent slowdown mechanic. This mod provides a way to slow down time, similar to how it is done in Katana Zero. 

# WARNING - THIS MOD IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

It should be properly functional, but issues may arise especially because this is the first plugin I have published. Feel free to reach out to me if you encounter issues. discord: daemon8363

More features and improvements are planned.

May conflict with other mods that deal with time, specifically 'Time.timeScale'.

# CUSTOMIZABILITY

Virtually every part of this mod is configurable. There are too many options to show, however I can say that the HUD, input, slow motion effect, visuals, and audio all have their options. 
Additionally, the audio and HUD can be changed inside of the audio and img folders.
