#WARNING - THIS MOD IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

It should be properly functional, but issues may arise especially because this is the first plugin I have published. Feel free to reach out to me if you encounter issues. discord: daemon8363
More features and improvements are planned.

May conflict with other mods that deal with time, specifically 'Time.timeScale'.

#CUSTOMIZABILITY

Virtually every part of this mod is configurable. The length of the list of every option is too long to exhaust in an image or two, but the HUD, input, slow motion effect, visuals, and audio all have their options. 
Additionally, the audio and HUD can be changed. Inside the audio and img folders are the assets used in the plugin. They can be changed if you want to.
