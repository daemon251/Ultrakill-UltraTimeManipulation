# OVERVIEW

This mod was inspired by the game 'Katana Zero', which has a prominent slowdown mechanic. This mod provides a way to slow down time, similar to how it is done in Katana Zero. 

# WARNING - THIS MOD IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

It should be properly functional, but issues may arise. Feel free to raise an issue on the github or reach out to me if you encounter issues on discord: daemon8363, preferably in #Ultrakill-modding in the New Blood Discord.

More features and improvements are planned.

May conflict with other mods that deal with time, specifically 'Time.timeScale'.

All custom images and audio will be overwritten when the mod is updated, so save copies of anything you change.

# CUSTOMIZABILITY

Virtually every part of this mod is configurable. There are too many options to show, however I can say that the HUD, input, slow motion effect, visuals, and audio all have their options. 
Additionally, the audio and HUD can be changed inside of the audio and img folders (they are in the main folder now as of 0.0.8).
